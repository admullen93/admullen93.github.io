# Setting Up Your Profile
Filling out your profile will allow other members to know who you are and better contact you.

The [official Slack documentation](https://slack.com/help/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-Slack-users) contains resources for new users,
including how to manage your profile and send messages.

You may wish to use [these steps](https://slack.com/help/articles/115005506003-Upload-a-profile-photo) to upload a profile photo.

Display name: You can use your name or a short handle like @example (they) or @first.last (they/them)
Your pronouns are optional but strongly encouraged. Having these visible helps TTS be gender inclusive. They’re not required because we want to ensure people who might change their pronouns don’t feel pressure to have an answer at all times.
What I do: Include your team here (required)
Location: Where you are (required)
For people with GSA emails, the Full name and Phone number are overwritten with your information from GCIMS every time you sign in, so don’t bother changing those.
Usage
Slack is used by all TTS staff. Some things you’ll want to remember, especially if you’re new to Slack:

# Using Slack
You can join any publicly available channel, or have another member invite you to a private channel they are a member of, 
via these instructions](https://slack.com/help/articles/205239967-Join-a-channel)

Abide by the TTS Code of Conduct. This includes use of avatars, emoji, files, and links. If you see anyone violating our Code of Conduct, see the reporting section.
Assume everything you share/do in Slack will be made public, and attributed back to you.
Do not post any sensitive information. See the list of alternatives.

@channel and @here
You may mention (or notify) members or entire channels with by following [these instructions](https://slack.com/help/articles/205240127-Use-mentions-in-Slack).
In general, the larger a channel is, the more careful you should be about using broadcast notifications, similar to using email groups.

Alumni
Keep the conversation visible within #alumni and don’t DM staff. For direct communication, use methods available to the general public, such as email.
If you would like documents or materials, you can either use publicly available methods to request that we publish them publicly, or you can file a FOIA request for GSA to release them. Don’t request materials that aren’t already public to be sent to you — even if they were non-sensitive or documents that you personally authored while you were here.
Don’t share job postings. This is especially true for your own employer, but applies to postings generally. We don’t want our #alumni channel to be providing advantages to any particular company due to someone’s access to it. You can use email or other publicly accessible methods to share job postings.
Security
GSA’s Slack Enterprise Grid is authorized at the Moderate level via a FedRAMP authorization.
