# Requesting Access
Anyone already in the Slack VA workspace can invite you as a member by [following these instructions](https://slack.com/help/articles/201330256-Invite-new-members-to-your-workspace).  
Alternatively, please fill out a DOTS tool request form for Slack with the [DOTS Help Desk](https://vajira.max.gov/servicedesk/customer/portal/1/group/3).  

VA Slack Enterprise Grid Handbook requires that a va.gov email address be used. If unavailable (such as for new hires, contractors, etc.), you may request a 90 day exception by visiting the [Exception Request page](exception).

Once you have been invited, you will receive an email that will guide you through account creation.

# Setting Up Your Profile
Filling out your profile will allow other members to know who you are and better contact you.

The [official Slack documentation](https://slack.com/help/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-Slack-users) contains resources for new users,
including how to manage your profile and send messages.

You may wish to use [these steps](https://slack.com/help/articles/115005506003-Upload-a-profile-photo) to upload a profile photo.

# Using Slack

You can join any publicly available channel, or have another member invite you to a private channel they are a member of, 
via [these instructions](https://slack.com/help/articles/205239967-Join-a-channel)

Assume everything you share/do in Slack will be made public, and attributed back to you.  
Do not post any sensitive information. 

You may mention (or notify) members or entire channels with by following [these instructions](https://slack.com/help/articles/205240127-Use-mentions-in-Slack).  
In general, the larger a channel is, the more careful you should be about using broadcast notifications, similar to using email groups.

[Keyboard shortcuts](https://slack.com/help/articles/201374536-Slack-keyboard-shortcuts) and 
[slash commands](https://slack.com/help/articles/201259356-Slash-commands-in-Slack) can be used to save time on a wide variety of commands.
